    "description": " Jungle Bird owner Krissy Harris found inspiration for this Old Fashioned riff in the tropical food and drink trends of the 1950s. “On many dishes from this time period, a maraschino cherry and ring of canned pineapple were the garnish, so I thought to split the rye base with Stiggin's Fancy Pineapple Rum and replace the sugar cube with maraschino liqueur. Instead of the classic Angostura bitters, which I felt would overpower the tropical notes, I used Punt e Mes vermouth for a more balanced flavor.”",

    "mixologist": "Wrap the spices and citrus zest in a large piece of cheesecloth, approximately 12 inches square, tying a knot to seal the bundle. Place the spice sack in non-reactive pot. Pour the wine into the pot and add the brandy. Simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally. When the mixture is warm, stir in the sugar, syrup or honey. Don't let the mulled wine boil, or you risk cooking out the flavors. Leave over low heat for about 30 minutes while the flavors meld. Continue stirring occasionally. When the liquid is steaming lightly, it is ready to serve. Ladle into warm mugs. Have lemon wedges and extra sugar on hand so guests can squeeze in extra acidity if they want to cut the sweetness or add more sugar to indulge a sweet tooth. Note: Adjust ingredients and proportions to personal taste, but don't let the sweetness overwhelm the wine's acidity or the drink will be cloying.",

Think of it as liquid fruitcake, except that your guests will actually be glad to see it when the holidays roll around.
